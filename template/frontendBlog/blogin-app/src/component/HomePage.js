                  <h3>Best Evidence Yet That Vitamin D Reduces Covid-19 Risk</h3>
                  <p>Vitamin D deficiency has been proposed as a risk factor for Covid-19 almost since the pandemic's start. 
                    Since vitamin D supplements are cheap and widely available, and sunlight is free, it would be fabulous news 
                    if this was true. However, despite many suggestive pieces of evidence, confirmation has been hard to find. 
                    A new study offers probably the best evidence yet that people with vitamin D deficiency are more likely to become 
                    infected, although it's still not as conclusive as scientists would like.

                  <p>The year 2020 will certainly have plenty of negative memories associated with it but if we are looking for positives, 
                    these first nine months have delivered us some incredible observations of the Sun, 
                    from Earth and from Space. The newly upgraded GREGOR telescope has just added to these with a fantastic contribution.
